# Fullstack Project 3 Wild Code School Biarritz : Lunetic

## First step

- In a terminal of your favorite IDE, create a clone of the "Lunetic_front" Github repository where you want the project to be installed (e.g. a "Project-Lunetic" folder):
  git clone git@github.com:Christelle-Legros/Lunetic_front.git

- In the same way, you also have to clone the "Lunetic_back" Github repository:
  git clone git@github.com:Christelle-Legros/Lunetic_back.git

## Second step

- In your terminal, you need to do an "npm install" in your terminal in order to install the dependencies that we need to run the app, for both Lunetic_front and Lunetic_back repo (make sure to change your current directory in your terminal to Lunetic_front folder and Lunetic_back folder respectively BEFORE npm install)

## Third step

- Run the front-end part of the app with "npm run dev" for Lunetic_front 
- Run the back-end part of the app with "npm run ts" to compile all typescript files (.ts) into javascript files (.js) first, then run with "npm start" for Lunetic_back

- Enjoy!
